# Traffic Simulation
This project consists of a simulation of the traffic of an Avenue, with the objective of finding a proposal to make the traffic more efficient. This simulation has two parts: the computational graphics and the multiagents part. The graphics part was done using the Three.js library and the multiagents part to simulate the way the cars and traffic lights acted and interacted with each other was done using the Agentpy library.
